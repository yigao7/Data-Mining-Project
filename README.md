# Data-Mining-Project

This repository contains codes for six data mining projects. In most of them I made use of Spark to handle large quantity of data.

1. Exploratory analysis of Yelp dataset
2. Frequent itemset detection using SON Algorithm
3. Locality Sensitive Hashing algorithm and recommendation system for Yelp
4. Community Detection Based on Girvan-Newman algorithm
5. Streaming data preocessing with Bloom Filtering, Flajolet-Martin algorithm, and Reservoir Sampling
6. Clustering with Bradley-Fayyad-Reina (BFR) algorithm
