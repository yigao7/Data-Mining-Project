# Data Mining Projects

This repository stores my work for six data mining projects.

1. Exploratory analysis of Yelp dataset
2. Frequent itemset detection using SON Algorithm
3. Locality Sensitive Hashing algorithm and recommendation system for Yelp
4. Community detection based on Girvan-Newman algorithm
5. Streaming data preocessing with Bloom Filtering, Flajolet-Martin algorithm, and Reservoir Sampling
6. Clustering with Bradley-Fayyad-Reina (BFR) algorithm
